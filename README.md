# SumElements

Write a program that returns the sum of all elements in a speciÔ¨Åed
column of a two-dimensional array.

Firstly ask the user to enter a 3-by-4 array. The user should enter the array
as follows:

   2.6    5.1    6    8
   
   5.4   4.4    7    1
   
   9.5   7.9    2    3

The program should then calculate the sum of each column in the array
